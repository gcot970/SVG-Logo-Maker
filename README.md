# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

This is a simple logo maker that creates different logos based off of user prompts. This is so each project that I make can always have a logo. This is done by utilizing classes to render the SVG contents to a file. With that, I've learned more troubleshooting techniques while trying to get my classes to cooperate with a base class-less code I've made previously.


## Installation

This requires the Inquirer package from NPM. Run npm start to get the environment up and running.

## Usage

Run 'node index.js' then answer the questions of each prompt, and it will provide you with examples like these:
![A red circle with white text that says App](examples/applogo.svg)
![A blue triangle with black text that says EAE](examples/eaelogo.svg)
![A green circle with white text that says SVG](examples/logo.svg)
![A grey box with black text that says Win](examples/Winlogo.svg)
![An animation of the program running](examples/example.gif)
